# Malar-Ai
Malar-ai is a handy device(based on smartphones) used to detect probable malaria infection using blood smear slides. 

Powered by pre-trained ResNet-50, cell-phone microscope and a staining kit, this setup is capable of performing at an accuracy of >95%, hence highly useful in remote and inaccessible areas.   


Files- 
-Build Dataset- @Tanay The data we have is categorised into 2- Parasitised and Non- Parasitised. Your task is to use this this file to distribute the dataset as Training, Testing and Validating. So, we will have 3 folders Testing Data, Training Data and Validation Data, with subfolders as Parasitised and non-parasitised. After that, iterate a loop over this dataset to create 3 numpy arrays as Testing_images, Training_images, Validation_images in such a way that @Rohan can import these numpy arrays from this file. Refer OS library.
