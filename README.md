# Malar-Ai
Malar-ai is a handy device(based on smartphones) used to detect probable malaria infection using blood smear slides. 

Powered by pre-trained ResNet-50, cell-phone microscope and a staining kit, this setup is capable of performing at an accuracy of >95%, hence highly useful in remote and inaccessible areas.
